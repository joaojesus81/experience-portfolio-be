This identified problem areas that were not accounted for in the spine system. Arup highlighted potential risk areas to the client and possible solutions. Part of this holistic assessment also saved the need for surface water pumping in one location—reducing cost and long term maintenance requirements. Arup adopted an approach to designing building drainage systems that minimised deep chambers, reducing the need for risky confined space access during maintenance. A number of value engineering opportunities were identified by Arup by challenging the tender design, including materials selection, and allowing certain areas to flood for extreme storms where there would be little or no consequences. A range of sustainable initiatives have been incorporated, which include the reuse of clean site arising for bund features and the use of swales and other SUDS elements. From a structural perspective, completely different methods needed to be employed to deal with the variety of construction types, with some of the buildings being steel frame type and some being of the concrete type.","ScopeOfWorks":"The University of Northampton previously operated from two campuses and they recognised that their existing estate did not provide facilities to ensure that they retain a competitive position in the sector in the future, and has therefore relocated to a new campus at Waterside close to the town centre as part of the wider Enterprise Zone within Northampton.\n\nWaterside Campus is a completely new campus offering an exciting environment whilst also co-locating all the university activities on one site together with residential accommodation for up to 1200 students. The brief was to transform a 58-acre brownfield site, on the banks of the River Nene into an innovative new campus. The site was formerly the home of a large coal fired power station and the works included its demolition, moving high voltage infrastructure, two new bridges over the river, providing five new academic buildings, restoring a listed building, building a student village, a hotel and an energy centre complete with mechanical and electrical infrastructure to serve the campus. \n\nThis new campus comprises 40,000m² of teaching space across five new academic buildings Learning Hub, Creative Hub, Senate Building, Sports Hub and Logistics Hub), including the refurbishment of a listed building and all the public realm works to redevelop the entire site around the academic, residential and utility buildings.

This five-storey building houses a library, shared general teaching areas, specialists’ skills spaces, student administration, academic workspaces and catering.

The Senate Building is a 5,600m² building and is the main reception building for the University and accommodates the senior management team and outward facing research space. This four-storey building houses the campus reception, general teaching, lecture theatre, seminar rooms and conference facilities. The Sports Hub provides sports and changing facilities and laboratories and the Logistics Hub is an industrial unit to provide open plan for storage of waste and maintenance equipment and an office area. The Engine Shed is an existing grade II listed locomotive building which has been restored and converted into a student union building and offices.

Situated on the University’s All Saints campus, the project is to create a new home for schools within the Faculty of Arts and Humanities namely Theatre, and Humanities, Languages and Social Sciences (HLSS) including creative writing and journalism. In doing so, the project seeks to redevelop a prominent site on the City’s Oxford Road corridor which was occupied by the Mabel Tylecote Building. The proposals provide for 12,000m² of new educational, cultural and public spaces, dovetailing with the adjacent Grade II listed Grosvenor Building, the original Manchester School of Art, to create a unified university arts centre. As well as new areas for teaching, the building is being designed to encourage strong public engagement through a porous and active ground floor with many uses. These include the newly established Manchester Poetry Library, a cafe/restaurant, public foyers/exhibition space and a 180-seat studio theatre. In addition, the building houses TV and radio studios, acting and voice studios all constructed as box-in-box to meet low background noise levels. The building is scheduled to be complete in April 2020. For further images see 245271 (pre-novation services. \n\nThe new building is constrained on all 4 sides. The new building abuts the existing Grade II listed Grosvenor building along the West elevation, while a Grade II listed retained façade sits within the footprint of the new building along the North elevation. The new building abuts the Oxford road pavement along the East elevation and Boundary St West along the South elevation. The primary superstructure frame to the new Arts & Humanities building is a hybrid multi-storey frame, comprising aspects of reinforced concrete and steel frame construction. The west half is primarily steel frame and the east half is primarily in situ reinforced concrete frame. A partial movement joint along the interface between the steel and concrete frames prevents lateral load transfer between the two. Cast-in connections are used at the interfaces between steel and concrete frame construction. The areas of steel frame construction and the interface locations are identified on the structural drawings. The steel frame structure is typically of braced frame construction. Long-span, storey-height trusses are required to achieve the long span and stiffness requirements of the floor over the theatre. Floor beams are required to act compositely with the floor slab and therefore require shear studs. The floor slab is typically reinforced concrete on composite metal deck. The reinforced concrete primary superstructure frame is typically in situ flat slab construction, with downstand band beams in long span areas. Transfer beams are provided in locations to achieve adjustments in the structural column grid to suit the architectural layouts.","Latitude":53.469722,"Longitude":-2.237222,"State":"GREATER MANCHESTER","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":95637,"ClientName":"Morgan Sindall Construction & Infrastructure Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25791800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25845800,"JobNameLong":"BUILDING THE LEEDS WAY (C&S) OBC STAGE","StartDate":"23/10/2017","EndDate":"31/08/2020","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC08","BusinessName":"Healthcare","ProjectDirectorID":34546,"ProjectDirectorName":"Jim Bell","ProjectManagerID":17049,"ProjectManagerName":"Derek Roberts","CountryName":"England","Town":"Leeds","ScopeOfService":"Civil and structural engineering design.","ScopeOfWorks":"c.£300million scheme for consolidation of Leeds Teaching Hospitals and expansion into research.","Latitude":53.806944,"Longitude":-1.519167,"State":"WEST YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":99.67,"ClientID":58686,"ClientName":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25845800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25875000,"JobNameLong":"3D CAPTURE - JLR SOLIHULL","StartDate":"16/10/2017","EndDate":"30/04/2019","CentreName":"Buildings Midlands","AccountingCentreCode":"01181","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC17","BusinessName":"Science, Industry & Technology","ProjectDirectorID":27416,"ProjectDirectorName":"Derek Lawrence","ProjectManagerID":27416,"ProjectManagerName":"Derek Lawrence","CountryName":"England","Town":"Solihull","ScopeOfService":"3D capture consultancy.","ScopeOfWorks":"Laser scanning of three blocks at the Solihull Advanced Manufacturing site and converting them into a Revit (BIM) format).","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","State":"WEST MIDLANDS","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":44009,"ClientName":"Jaguar Land Rover Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25875000","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25979600,"JobNameLong":"TRU SECTION 2","StartDate":"22/01/2018","EndDate":"30/09/2020","CentreName":"Rail NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01212","PracticeName":"Rail Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC14","BusinessName":"Rail","ProjectDirectorID":9736,"ProjectDirectorName":"Andy Belcham","ProjectManagerID":70836,"ProjectManagerName":"Jose Carrasco","CountryName":"England","Town":"Leeds","ScopeOfService":"Single option selection design","ScopeOfWorks":"Transpennine Route Upgrade (TPRU) West of Leeds.
