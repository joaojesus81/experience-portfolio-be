Maggie’s pioneering approach provides emotional, practical and social support to cancer sufferers and their families, using highly considered architecture to create beneficial environments.\n\nSteven Holl’s strongly graphic vision was inspired by medieval neume musical notation, neume appropriately meaning ‘vital force’. His 'three vessel' concept layers a perforated concrete wrapping structure, cloaked within a curved translucent façade and housing a third, bamboo lined interior. Designed to exude light and calm, its openness allows natural light to wash over the floors and walls.\n\nThe complex sculptural concrete frame features large voids, branching verticals and curved corners. To create a globally stable structure, we rationalised its geometry, using a BIM model to conduct FE analysis. The open, curved staircase was formed monolithically within the concrete frame, point connected to the concrete branches from which it cantilevers.\n\nRecreating Holl’s trademark watercolour designs with a hard material such as glass resulted in a world-first for cladding, using light-diffusing Okalux glass in curved geometry. The concept pushed the tolerances of curved glass, with flat, cylindrically curved and J-shaped double glazed units. This was further complicated by the embedded coloured swathes which also posed a risk of thermal breakage.To deliver the combined structural and thermal performance of the glass, we developed a bespoke approach using the latest in digital design and analysis.\n\nMaggie’s provide a unique approach to holistic cancer support and the Arup team is immensely proud to have helped realise the latest centre.

Construction of a new data centre, UK Hemel Hempstead 3, known as “The Campus”, to meet the growing demand for scalable and reliable colocation services. Located at a 38,500m² site near two existing Gyron data centres in Hemel Hempstead, the new facility will start providing approximately 10,000m² of server room from spring 2015, expanding NTT Com’s total server room area in the UK by 2.5 times. By using advanced green technology for cooling, such as end wall injection air conditioning, water-side economization, and chimney racks to expel heat, the facility achieves a power usage effectiveness (PUE) of under 1.2, putting it among the most energy efficient data centres in the UK. It will also be the first large scale commercial colocation data centre in the UK to offer the option of a chillerless cooling system, which opens up approximately 30% more energy capacity for ICT systems without expanding its power system and without introducing outside air in to the server room. The facility further reduces NTT Com’s environmental load by using rain water in the air conditioning, generating electricity from solar panels, and using heat from the server equipment to warm office areas in the winter. By incorporating a modular design concept, electric power, air conditioning and communication equipment are scalable in each server room, and redundancy systems can be freely set. Tier IV upgrades are also available as customers require. Moreover, the facility will incorporate security measures beyond the industry standard, including a four-metre-high peripheral fence, barriers against vehicle attacks and fire-prevention equipment installed in each module. The high-speed, high-quality networks connecting the new facility with other NTT Com data centres will enable the low-cost, low-latency access necessary to effectively provide a hybrid cloud environment that combines on-premise systems, colocation and NTT Com’s Enterprise Cloud to better meet varied customer demand and optimize ICT systems. In addition, the high-speed connections between Gyron’s three Hemel Hempstead data centres and two Slough data centres will allow them to operate essentially as one data centre, making it fast and easy to provide more server equipment and virtual servers for customers expanding their business.","Latitude":51.761944,"Longitude":-0.4375,"State":"HERTFORDSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":27456,"ClientName":"Gyron Internet Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=23121800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":23298800,"JobNameLong":"GRENADIER HOUSE","StartDate":"02/08/2013","EndDate":"31/08/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":21643,"ProjectDirectorName":"David Stow","ProjectManagerID":21643,"ProjectManagerName":"David Stow","CountryName":"England","Town":"London","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering services.","ScopeOfWorks":"The scheme involves the development of a residential retirement home with the current proposal being five floors of residential accommodation above ground and a basement level occupying part of the site.

Extensive client briefing sessions where held with the Estates Department in order to understand the client’s concerns and lessons learnt from the fire incident and the resulting loss of power. These client discussions determined the detailed brief and requirements which we converted into engineering solutions. The scope of works required the installation of a new main switchboard in the Alfred Denny building, transferring the existing armoured sub-mains cables from the temporary panel boards into the new switchboard, and the installation of new cables. A new main switchboard was also installed in a new switch room to serve the Edwardian Building. The project had significant constraints to ensure cable transfers were carried out in a timely manner which allowed continued operation of the faculty. Due to the sensitivity of the building’s faculty, extensive discussions where held with the faculty to understand the time restrictions for the cable transfers and having power off to equipment and rooms. The faculty advised that the time slots and power outage were to be kept to a minimum to reduce disruption to the department. There were 33No. sub-main circuits which had to be transferred in limited time slots, over a time period. With this information, we spent considerable time thinking through the operations needed to transfer the cables. We used our extensive practical installation knowledge and experience to determine the time required to transfer each cable. From this we developed a detailed programme and diagrams setting out a total of 14No. shutdown sequences with time allocations for each cable transfer. This shutdown sequences programme and diagrams were presented to the Estates and faculty departments and were agreed. These same shutdown sequences programme and diagrams were issued with the tender documentation for the Contractors to include the appropriate time and material costs in their tender returns. The Contractor confirmed that the sequences and time allocations were achievable from their own site knowledge and experience. As such the project was actually executed in line with our shutdown sequences. We undertook site monitoring activities through the site works, and kept a tight rein on the Contractor’s working sequences and quality of installations.

This was followed in early 2015 by detailed intrusive façade investigations of 388 Glossop Road and the Hadfield Tower by rope access. During the façade investigations of these two buildings, bricks were removed and replaced, concrete samples were taken and sent for lab testing, and a video boroscope was used to inspect cavities. Reports were written giving recommendations for remedial works or temporary measures to protect pedestrians near the building.","ScopeOfWorks":"Structural surveys for the University of Sheffield, including rope access façade investigations. Arup has carried out extensive structural surveys on the University of Sheffield’s estate from domestic-scale properties to tall building façade inspections by rope access. This was initially a suite of inspections largely covering building elements bridging over publicly accessible spaces. The studies identified overall condition and specific defects and made recommendations for remedial work including banded costs and timescales for undertaking this work. This allowed these works to be planned into current and/or future years’ maintenance works. A clear summary table with traffic-light annotation allowed this information and the risk profile to be easily understood, and then interrogated in more detail through each digitally linked individual report. Following this work, we were approached to undertake a series of surveys of other structures including facades, retaining walls, churches, service tunnels, and basements. The ages of these structures varied from hundreds to only a few years and includes many 1950-70s reinforced concrete structures. Delivered by our Sheffield team who have extensive experience in working with existing structures, including being the Arup UKMEA centre for rope access surveys, we were also able to utilize wider national expertise where necessary to ensure all structures were appropriately assessed and reviewed. We believe our continued relationship has been built on our understanding of the University’s requirements and risk appetite. We have been proactive engaging with the estates and maintenance teams to ensure that we have a clear picture of what their requirements, as well as providing the right level of service and restricting the costs of rope access inspections to where necessary. Some surveys do require close inspection and we have provided cost-effective rope access services which avoid the use of cherry pickers which would be time-consuming and often involve expensive road closures. Our rope access team facilitated surveys to several particularly difficult-to-access facades and enabled detailed assessments which informed appropriate decisions to be made in relation to safety and overall strategies for building maintenance and potential refurbishment. As an example, we undertook abseiling inspections of the Husband Building, during which we identified defects which could result in pieces of cladding falling. On several occasions, we have subsequently been involved in developing temporary or permanent remedial details. Understanding the future plan for a structure is important so that the right considerations can be made to durability to avoid unnecessary costs. In the case of the Husband Building, we advised on or developed appropriate temporary remedial solutions to restrain or catch any unsecured pieces of cladding. Following an abseiling inspection of Chemistry West, we detailed a permanent propping solution to provide an alternative load path for supporting beams which were relying on degrading joints. Understanding the behaviour of historic structures is also important to ensure that practical and appropriate remediation is implemented. Such structures are often difficult to justify, and we use our experience to ensure appropriately-engineered solutions are provided. For example, we have recently undertaken a full rope-access inspection of the steelwork of Blackpool Tower and are developing sensitive remedial details.","Latitude":53.382222,"Longitude":-1.486389,"State":"SOUTH YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":92.02,"ClientID":67117,"ClientName":"University of Sheffield","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=23661700","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":23680200,"JobNameLong":"LIVERPOOL FC EXPANSION PROJECT","StartDate":"01/05/2014","EndDate":"31/03/2020","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC19","BusinessName":"Sport","ProjectDirectorID":34546,"ProjectDirectorName":"Jim Bell","ProjectManagerID":34574,"ProjectManagerName":"Mark Joynson","CountryName":"England","Town":"Liverpool","ScopeOfService":"Structural, mechanical, electrical, public health, fire, acoustic, security and communications and appointment AFL for architecture.

It was paramount that this ambitious scheme provided quality engineering facilities whilst offering value within the appropriate budgetary constraints. Arup played a key role in the achievement of both goals through collaboration with the architectural team on an inspiring and structurally efficient feature roof. We led on the generation of the form of the roof, collaborating on the initial conceptual form with the architect to engineer a roof such that its geometry defined its structural performance, deliberately relying on its geometric stiffness to make material savings. From the initial concept and constraint analysis we utilised high-end parametric Grasshopper scripting to rationalise the form further, ensuring that other constraints such as glass proportions were addressed. With the University’s operation and maintenance of the building post-completion in mind, Arup’s parametric generation of the roof geometry also ensured appropriate gradients were generated throughout to avoid rain staining and informing the maintenance strategy. The new build elements of the project that bookend the north and south ends of the courtyard house specialist laboratories including laser and precision mechanical engineering capabilities that presented the structural engineering challenge of maintaining large, open spaces but that also met appropriate floor vibration limits. This required careful analysis and attention to detailing to give a practical and visually light structural and we devised a tapered cantilevered slab solution to achieve this. To ensure the roof movements were appropriately managed, careful consideration of their interaction with the concrete stability system was also required. An iterative cracked stiffness assessment of the primary frames behaviour allowed the stability elements to be minimised across the scheme. To provide cost certainty and de-risk a key element of the scheme at an early stage Arup proposed, and oversaw, the technical aspects of a Two-Stage PCSA process for the roof, which sat beside the single-stage main contractor D&B procurement. In conjunction with a separate enabling package this allowed the main contract to avoid high risk related cost allocations form the D&B contractor and greatly improve programme and cost certainty. Post contractor appointment the University retained our expertise client side to ensure they could maintain the quality of the product. Whilst working collaboratively with the wider team, we provided a robust and detailed review process throughout, ensuring that the specialist contractor maintains the quality of detailing tendered and reducing risk associated with this challenging scheme.","ScopeOfWorks":"Heartspace project - lot 1 'new build' elements. The Heartspace Project is the creation of a quadruple height atrium between the Grade II listed Sir Frederick Mappin Building and the 1885 Central Wing housing new laboratories, offices and social space and the complete refurbishment of both buildings. The atrium will be housed under an impressive curved glass roof that will link the two buildings. An alternative entrance to both the Mappin and Central Block buildings will be created from Portobello Street. The project is designed to aid communication and collaboration. The University of Sheffield’s Engineering Heartspace project is updating the aging facilities in this part of the estate and addresses the disconnect within the existing Mappin Estate, which currently is a barrier to departmental cooperation and detracts from student experience. It achieves this through transformation of an existing courtyard into a new quadruple height fully enclosed atrium space, improving circulation routes within the Faculty and providing a space for collaboration below the curved glass roof.","Latitude":53.381111,"Longitude":-1.47,"State":"SOUTH YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":67117,"ClientName":"University of Sheffield","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=23823000","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":23871900,"JobNameLong":"WOOD WHARF A1 FIRE","StartDate":"01/07/2014","EndDate":"31/12/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":21643,"ProjectDirectorName":"David Stow","ProjectManagerID":21643,"ProjectManagerName":"David Stow","CountryName":"England","Town":"London","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering services from scheme design through construction.","ScopeOfWorks":"57 storey residential tower with lobby and retail units at lower levels, connecting into large master plan basement.","Latitude":51.5025,"Longitude":-0.011389,"State":"GREATER LONDON","PercentComplete":96.35,"ClientID":103562,"ClientName":"CW One Park Drive Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=23871900","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":23872000,"JobNameLong":"WOOD WHARF A2/3 FIRE","StartDate":"01/07/2014","EndDate":"30/09/2021","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":21643,"ProjectDirectorName":"David Stow","ProjectManagerID":21643,"ProjectManagerName":"David Stow","CountryName":"England","Town":"London","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering services from planning through to construction.","ScopeOfWorks":"Building A2 is a 12 storey residential building and building A3 is a 41 storey residential building.

When the depot was originally built, the electrification system only existed outside of the depot itself. Re-using the original 1960s structures, we developed an innovative solution to bring the electrification system inside the depot, making the electric trains safer and easier to maintain. Re-purposing the existing structural frames of the building, we integrated the new electrification system into the roof, designing it to run continuously from one end of the depot to another. We called upon the expertise of our structural engineers to ensure the building performance could adapt to the significantly upgraded and modernised OLE equipment. We introduced sustainable design approaches including bringing as much natural light as possible through the depot building and specifying thermally insulated walls to reduce energy consumption.

This identified problem areas that were not accounted for in the spine system. Arup highlighted potential risk areas to the client and possible solutions. Part of this holistic assessment also saved the need for surface water pumping in one location—reducing cost and long term maintenance requirements. Arup adopted an approach to designing building drainage systems that minimised deep chambers, reducing the need for risky confined space access during maintenance. A number of value engineering opportunities were identified by Arup by challenging the tender design, including materials selection, and allowing certain areas to flood for extreme storms where there would be little or no consequences. A range of sustainable initiatives have been incorporated, which include the reuse of clean site arising for bund features and the use of swales and other SUDS elements.

The brief was to transform a 58-acre brownfield site, on the banks of the River Nene into an innovative new campus. The site was formerly the home of a large coal fired power station and the works included its demolition, moving high voltage infrastructure, two new bridges over the river, providing five new academic buildings, restoring a listed building, building a student village, a hotel and an energy centre complete with mechanical and electrical infrastructure to serve the campus. \n\nThis new campus comprises 40,000m² of teaching space across five new academic buildings Learning Hub, Creative Hub, Senate Building, Sports Hub and Logistics Hub), including the refurbishment of a listed building and all the public realm works to redevelop the entire site around the academic, residential and utility buildings. The buildings have been designed to accommodate all the teaching, learning, admin, commercial and leisure activities as well as providing exemplary learning and working environments for the occupants, with high energy performance. \n\nThe Learning Hub is the largest building of 21,000m² at the heart of the new campus. This five-storey building houses a library, shared general teaching areas, specialists’ skills spaces, student administration, academic workspaces and catering. It will be open 24 hours a day and will create a vibrant, dynamic and flexible environment. The Creative Hub is a 10,000m² building over five storeys and brings together all the creative art, design and performing art disciplines and science teaching into one building. The Senate Building is a 5,600m² building and is the main reception building for the University and accommodates the senior management team and outward facing research space. This four-storey building houses the campus reception, general teaching, lecture theatre, seminar rooms and conference facilities. The Sports Hub provides sports and changing facilities and laboratories and the Logistics Hub is an industrial unit to provide open plan for storage of waste and maintenance equipment and an office area. The Engine Shed is an existing grade II listed locomotive building which has been restored and converted into a student union building and offices. In addition to the academic buildings, the entire site has been remediated and transformed. The public realm works across the entire campus were essential to create a high quality, distinctive, innovative and inspiring place which supports all those who live and work there.

MB enables ease of construction and allows distributed fabrication, so those with limited experience can build to a high quality, meeting Passivhaus standards where desired, at a lower cost than traditional building methods. Whilst discussing prefabricated houses to meet the housing crisis, Design for Homes’ David Birkbeck said: ‘Prefab works well if you have extensive repetition. But we don’t do repetition in the UK because… of oddly shaped pieces of land requiring sensitive responses… we have yet to see a successful example that has broken out from the niche.’ MB Bespoke addresses this issue by incorporating parametrics into a system that can output bespoke, modular, prefabricated houses, the issue of varying land shape & form is ameliorated by overcoming the previous constraints of repetition.

A 16,000m² building to act as the Hub for the Royce Institute, the UK National Centre for research and innovation of Advanced Materials. It will house world-leading materials scientists, state-of-the-art equipment, and collaborative space for industrial engagement. The ambition for the project is to become an international flagship for material sciences. The Royce Institute is strategically located on the University of Manchester campus. Its completion, and that of the nearby new engineering complex (MECD project), will result in a significant group of facilities for research and collaboration. Arup’s servicing strategy responds to the need to provide flexibility and adaptability for the building services to be changed to suit the housing of processes, some of which cannot be clearly envisaged or defined today. Close dialogue with various stakeholders and numerous end-user groups throughout the design stages allowed reconciliation of the spatial and servicing needs of user defined equipment. Liaison has been required with the University of Manchester to ensure that the building complies with their design and maintenance requirements. To accommodate changes in research topics and changing needs, the servicing strategy has been designed around a bay system, aligned to the structural grid. Levels of ventilation and cooling are available to each bay via a VAV system to allow new heat producing equipment to be added in the future. House laboratory gases, fume extract ventilation, process cooling, small power and data are provided, to currently known proposed equipment layouts, or to capped locations in risers for future connections. To allow for future growth, two floors of ‘expansion space’ will be provided. This gives an additional level of complexity to the services design, requiring prediction of potential future requirements and the need to provide suitable connections and interface points to minimise disruption to the rest of the building. To realise an energy efficient design and achieve the project carbon objectives and BREEAM ‘Excellent’ target, Arup investigated a range of energy efficient measures alongside low and zero carbon energy sources. The primary energy strategy for the building centres on the connection of the building to a local University of Manchester district heating scheme.

The retail space totals 100,000 sq ft over two floors, while the office space totals 155,000ft² of net lettable space arranged over four floors around a central atrium. The majority of the office has been designed for a financial institution, with an exclusive entrance from the north east corner of the building. The balance of the office space is being built on speculative basis and is accessed from a separate entrance on the opposite end of the building. There is a set back at the uppermost level to create a south-facing roof terrace. The main roof has a plant screen set back from the facades and provides the location for the MEP equipment.\n\nIn addition to the office and retail space there is circa 25,000ft² of ancillary space associated with the main office tenant including 19 car spaces, cycle facilities and a back of house function along with a service yard. The majority of this is within a basement area that partially sits outside the building footprint.\n\nThe overarching energy strategy for the project is built around demand minimisation supported by robust engineering systems that utilise energy efficiency over the full range of annual operating conditions. Where technology is adopted to enhance the energy performance it will be proven and integrated in to the total building solution to provide reliable performance without compromising the building operational needs. In response to the City Council planning policy, the building takes benefit from the city wide district heating, providing a source of low carbon energy, and limiting the need for boiler flues exhausts within the building.\n\nThe services strategy has been developed to maintain clear segregation between the Financial Institution and retail MEP services installation, and associated access and maintenance.\nThe Sub-Tenant areas within the Financial Institution floorplate/s will be fed from the Financial Institution infrastructure with metering as required to apportion energy usage. Retail will be serviced from centralised ventilation, heating and cooling plant:\n\n• Heating and water plant rooms are to be located within the basement within retail plant room having a dedicated district heating connection, the retail will have no boiler flues.\n• Ventilation plant is intended to be installed within the plant room on mezzanine Level 20. Supply and extract louvres from the retail plant room will discharge towards Galleria/Pinstone Street.\n• Centralised cooling plant will be located on the roof of the nearest Food and Beverage Units accessed from Charter Row.\n• Food and beverage (F&B) kitchen extract fans will be located on the F&B roof plant area.\n\nThe office includes for all ventilation plant at roof level with space for dedicated plant to the restaurant and gym. The office landlords life safety generator will be located at roof level being coordinated to ensure exhaust maintain separation from fresh air intakes. As the site falls away from front to back by approximately one clear storey, opportunity has been taken to create a large basement/at grade plant room zone for Financial Institution MEP services. These prime plant rooms will accommodate many all of the heavy bulk water (potable and sprinkler) and standby generator fuel storage tanks, substations, and main incoming services with defined routes to the foot of each core riser. Access to the basement plant areas will be through the dedicated secure basement car park.","Latitude":53.378333,"Longitude":-1.472222,"State":"SOUTH YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":87659,"ClientName":"Bam Construction Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=24907400","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":24909300,"JobNameLong":"AMEC: PRIME PCC PROJECTS","StartDate":"17/04/2016","EndDate":"30/04/2018","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC08","BusinessName":"Healthcare","ProjectDirectorID":48666,"ProjectDirectorName":"Alistair Murray","ProjectManagerID":48666,"ProjectManagerName":"Alistair Murray","CountryName":"England","Town":"","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering services.\nUndertake an independent review of the above noted buildings, providing expert advice on the compliance of the construction of the above premises with relevant fire safety requirements (whether arising under fire safety legislation or building regulations requirements).

Arup Acoustics were also appointed to undertake an acoustic assessment pre and post construction to ensure no detrimental effects were caused to the room acoustics through upgrades to the roof structure. In addition to this we took on the role of Principal Designer. The main challenge on this project was designing retrofit solutions that would cause minimal alterations to this iconic building. Additionally, solutions could not impact on the views from the audience to the stage. We presented our findings in relation to the thermal comfort issues, which included; CFD analysis, smoke testing (validations) and temperature logging We were subsequently awarded a further commission to undertake the detailed design of our proposal to alleviate high temperatures / thermal discomfort. This also included extended advice in relation to room acoustics. As Principal Designer, Arup were responsible for the health and safety aspects of the project preconstruction. We assisted the Client in understand risks associated with the project and tracked and managed those risks utilising a hazard risk register. We also ensured That design workshops took place to ensure risks were eliminate where possible and mitigated if this was not possible. These risks were documented and passed onto the Contractor as part of the tender pack. The theatre has increased their ticket prices to finance the enhancement(s) and a press release will be made later this year. The key lesson learned on this project was the importance of bringing the client along on the journey to ensure that they are bought in to the proposed solution.

The land that sits within the loop was originally inaccessible and formed an island until bridges were built at different points in the past to cross the canals, firstly for pedestrians and then later for vehicles. Historically, the land in and around the canal was used for industry and has been home to lots of factories and trades over the years. However, over the past few decades the area has become increasingly unused and neglected to the point that no businesses trade within the Icknield Port Loop anymore. Because of this, Birmingham City Council decided that the land was in much need of regeneration and thus a masterplan to develop the site was started.\n\nThe now named simply ‘Port Loop’ project is a large residential regeneration scheme that includes the construction of a new housing development on the land within and around the canals. The project will see 43 acres of land turned into 1,150 new homes which comprise of houses ranging from 3 to 5 bedrooms as well as some apartments. There will also be various retail and leisure facilities included within the scheme, as well as the inclusion of excellent travel links, walkways, cycle routes and a swimming pool. In addition, the development will feature a ‘Tubeworks hub’, which is a community centre area that could include shops such as bakeries, coffee shops and markets etc. There will even be a waterbus that residents can use to travel around the neighbourhood via the canals. It is intended that the Port Loop will provide a new social community environment where people can live and work sustainably, with strong focus being put into factors such as the community parks and wildlife.\n\nIn terms of delivery, the project has been divided into multiple phases. Arup have been involved in the initial planning stages for this project as well as providing civil and structural engineering for phases 1a and 1b. Phase 1a includes the first set of modular houses, of which Arup provided foundation design for up to RIBA stage 4. For phase 1b, Arup have thus far provided foundation design as well as plumbing and drainage services up to RIBA stage 3. Arup are also likely to be involved in the later phases of this project and could provide both mechanical and electrical engineering design services for the houses and other facilities within the scheme.\n\nThe project is currently in progress with phase 1a works having already begun on site.","Latitude":52.481111,"Longitude":-1.929722,"State":"WEST MIDLANDS","PercentComplete":97.64,"ClientID":150191,"ClientName":"PFP US Ipl Llp C/O Urbansplash","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25254500","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25259800,"JobNameLong":"QUEEN STREET RAILWAY STATION (FIRE)","StartDate":"18/11/2016","EndDate":"10/03/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC14","BusinessName":"Rail","ProjectDirectorID":48666,"ProjectDirectorName":"Alistair Murray","ProjectManagerID":48541,"ProjectManagerName":"Hugh McNamara","CountryName":"Scotland","Town":"Glasgow","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering services.","ScopeOfWorks":"Outline approach for fire strategy and review for the Queen Street Railway Station.","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","State":"GLASGOW","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":80279,"ClientName":"Network Rail Limited","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25259800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25270900,"JobNameLong":"BERLIN AIRPORT FIRE REVIEW - ADDITIONAL SCOPE","StartDate":"04/07/2016","EndDate":"08/09/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC02","BusinessName":"Aviation","ProjectDirectorID":14857,"ProjectDirectorName":"Barbara Lane","ProjectManagerID":50560,"ProjectManagerName":"Judith Schulz","CountryName":"Germany","Town":"Berlin","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering services.","ScopeOfWorks":"Additional scope for the Berlin Brandenburg Airport fire review","Latitude":52.366667,"Longitude":13.503333,"State":"BERLIN","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":13081,"ClientName":"European Investment Bank","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25270900","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25281200,"JobNameLong":"PARADISE TWO CHAMBERLAIN SQUARE CONTRACTOR","StartDate":"30/11/2016","EndDate":"31/01/2021","CentreName":"Buildings Midlands","AccountingCentreCode":"01181","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":7389,"ProjectDirectorName":"Daniel Goodreid","ProjectManagerID":17052,"ProjectManagerName":"Richard Pearce","CountryName":"England","Town":"Birmingham","ScopeOfService":"Structural, mechanical, electrical and public health engineering.","ScopeOfWorks":"Novation to Hermes for the Paradise Two Chamberlain Square development.","Latitude":52.479722,"Longitude":-1.905,"State":"WEST MIDLANDS","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":46071,"ClientName":"BAM Construct UK Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25281200","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25295600,"JobNameLong":"NEWCASTLE HOSPITALS PFI - REME","StartDate":"05/12/2016","EndDate":"30/09/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC08","BusinessName":"Healthcare","ProjectDirectorID":14857,"ProjectDirectorName":"Barbara Lane","ProjectManagerID":27186,"ProjectManagerName":"Nick Troth","CountryName":"England","Town":"Newcastle","ScopeOfService":"Monitoring of passive and active systems remedial work.

However, this building had become very outdated and was unoccupied from 2003. The building was considered to be in need of rejuvenation and was therefore demolished in 2016 to make way for a new development.\n\nNow, a scheme is in place to replace the NatWest Tower with a new £80 million building. The new 103 Colmore Row is a 26-storey high rise building and will comprise of 20 floors of Grade A office space, an underground car park, a winter garden and two restaurants as well as a terrace area on the upper floors allowing spectacular views across the city. Located in the centre of Birmingham’s business district, the vision is that this building becomes a landmark attraction for businesses in the years to come. The building is set to become Birmingham’s tallest office building and is targeting a BREEAM rating of Excellent.\n\nIn terms of the MEP design, the main plant areas are located in the 4 basement floors and 3 roof plant floors, and host various mechanical and electrical equipment for servicing the building. Mechanically, the heating load is provided by a district heat network as well as a CHP unit located in the basement. Main cooling to the building is provided by 2 chiller units located on the roof, with the heating/cooling to the office spaces then provided via local 4-pipe fan coil units. Ventilation for the building is provided via 7 air handling units located across the plant areas. Electrically, the building is supplied via a single HV connection (~3MVA) from the local DNO, which then feeds two transformers (1 in the basement and 1 on the roof level) each with an accompanying switchboard. The roof level switchboard is used to supply the building’s lifts, fire-fighting lobbies (lighting and small power) and the upper restaurant, as well as all the mechanical loads located on the roof such as chillers and air handling units. The basement switchboard is used to supply power to all tenant floors of the building via a rising busbar and there is also a separate busbar dedicated to the landlord which supplies power to the circulation spaces and toilets within the building. In addition, the two switchboards are interlinked to provide resilience in case of a failure or planned maintenance on one switchboard, and there is solar PV included on the roof which supports a sustainable building design. Finally, there is also a standby generator included which will supply power to the life safety systems in the building, in case of a mains power outage.\n\nThe building has begun its construction phase in summer of 2018 and is due for practical completion in late 2020.","Latitude":52.480833,"Longitude":-1.901389,"State":"WEST MIDLANDS","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":87659,"ClientName":"Bam Construction Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25676200","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25676500,"JobNameLong":"M&S MEADOWHALL (FIRE)","StartDate":"20/07/2017","EndDate":"30/09/2018","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC16","BusinessName":"Retail","ProjectDirectorID":48666,"ProjectDirectorName":"Alistair Murray","ProjectManagerID":48716,"ProjectManagerName":"Brian Morrell","CountryName":"England","Town":"Sheffield","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering.","ScopeOfWorks":"Fit out of an Marks & Spencer in Meadowhall shopping centre.","Latitude":53.414722,"Longitude":-1.41,"State":"SOUTH YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":69111,"ClientName":"Marks & Spencers Plc","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25676500","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25679900,"JobNameLong":"WOOD WHARF C1","StartDate":"24/07/2017","EndDate":"08/09/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":21643,"ProjectDirectorName":"David Stow","ProjectManagerID":21643,"ProjectManagerName":"David Stow","CountryName":"England","Town":"London","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering advice.","ScopeOfWorks":"New commercial office building on the Wood Wharf estate.","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","State":"GREATER LONDON","PercentComplete":95.06,"ClientID":102130,"ClientName":"CWG (Wood Wharf Two) Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25679900","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25680900,"JobNameLong":"UNIVERSITY OF LEICESTER ADRIAN FIRE COMPARTMENTS","StartDate":"24/07/2017","EndDate":"31/03/2020","CentreName":"Buildings Midlands","AccountingCentreCode":"01181","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC05","BusinessName":"Education","ProjectDirectorID":17052,"ProjectDirectorName":"Richard Pearce","ProjectManagerID":46179,"ProjectManagerName":"Joshua Patrick","CountryName":"England","Town":"Leicester","ScopeOfService":"Mechanical, electrical, public health, and fire engineering.","ScopeOfWorks":"Review to establish the extent that fire compartmentation is compromised and to establish feasibility for remedial works.","Latitude":52.621111,"Longitude":-1.124444,"State":"LEICESTERSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":67018,"ClientName":"University of Leicester","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25680900","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25686500,"JobNameLong":"UNI OF HULL COURTYARD BUILDING","StartDate":"26/07/2017","EndDate":"31/03/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":27186,"ProjectDirectorName":"Nick Troth","ProjectManagerID":40319,"ProjectManagerName":"Tomasz Kasprus","CountryName":"England","Town":"Kingston upon Hull","ScopeOfService":"Desktop review of as-built drawings of external envelope against fire strategy specification.\n \nFire safety inspections of installed cladding.","ScopeOfWorks":"Fire safety advice in relation to external envelope of Courtyard Building site -

A rating of NR20 is required as minimum to ensure no sound from the engine test station can escape into the music studio and vice versa.","ScopeOfWorks":"This project is specifically related to demolishing the Helena Kennedy building at the Headington Campus of Oxford Brookes University and replacing it with a new ‘Theatre of Making’ for the Faculty of Technology, Design and Environment.\n\nOxford Brookes University currently consists of four separate campuses. The main three locations are the Headington Campus, the Harcourt Hill Campus and the Wheatley Campus, with the fourth Swindon Campus being located outside of Oxford and used purely for healthcare-related courses. However, the university has decided they have more estate than they need and have thus begun a ten-year plan to condense some of their current facilities, and to relocate them whilst upgrading them in the process. This includes building new teaching facilities, refurbishing some of the student accommodation and improving travel links, as well as moving their current activities at the Wheatley Campus over to the Headington Campus.\n\nThe Headington Campus is made up of three sites, which are the Headington Hill site, the Marston Road site and the Gypsy Lane site. The Headington Hill site is the largest of the three and is the location that was identified as being the most in need of upgrading. The site is currently made up of several buildings including a drama studio, sports centre and arts facility, as well as a student centre (known previously as the ‘Helena Kennedy’ building) which was used as the Students Union until 2014 when it was vacated. The Helena Kennedy building was over 50 years old and was in much need of redevelopment.\n\nThe new building is a £25m multifunctional academic building and is intended to become a hub for various teaching, research and practical learning exercises to take place. The building will contain multiple open learning areas and will be used by many disciplines across the university, from Arts and Science to Computing and Engineering. It is made up of various creative spaces, labs and teaching rooms and is intended to encourage innovative thinking and collaboration amongst the students. More specifically, the ground floor will have a digital arts space which includes a theatre and green screen, as well as a live music studio, multiple architectural and engineering workshops and an engine test facility. The first floor of the building includes social learning spaces, a café and a control booth for the theatre lighting, where students can work to develop different stage lighting scenes and effects for performing arts purposes.\n\nIn terms of the building services design, heating of the building is provided by three gas-fired boilers located in a boiler room on the ground floor. Cooling is provided via a chiller located on the roof which provides chilled water to air handling units and fan coil units. The building uses a combination of natural and mechanical ventilation. The mechanical ventilation is provided via 2 air handling units located on the roof and is used for areas with high internal heat gains, whereas natural ventilation is included where possible to support a sustainable building design. Electrically, there is one main substation that supplies the site with power. There are two incoming supplies from the substation to the site. The first supply is for the electrical loads of the building and the second is dedicated specifically to the engine test facility (due to its high electrical demand). There is currently no provision for backup power in this building and so no standby generator is included in the design, however there is provision for a temporary generator to connect into the switchboard, which would supply the building’s electrical load in the event of an emergency or for planned maintenance.\n\nThe building is set for completion in summer 2020.","Latitude":51.755,"Longitude":-1.229167,"State":"OXFORDSHIRE","PercentComplete":72.42,"ClientID":23299,"ClientName":"Oxford Brookes University","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25703800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25708600,"JobNameLong":"RCP NORTH SMEP STAGE 2","StartDate":"01/08/2017","EndDate":"13/11/2018","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC17","BusinessName":"Science, Industry & Technology","ProjectDirectorID":62941,"ProjectDirectorName":"Andy Pennington","ProjectManagerID":31296,"ProjectManagerName":"Pete Thompson","CountryName":"England","Town":"Liverpool","ScopeOfService":"Civil, structural, mechanical, electrical, public health, acoustics, fire, WELL building consultancy, fire engineering sprinkler design to RIBA Stage 2.","ScopeOfWorks":"Royal College of Physicians North centre.","Latitude":53.406111,"Longitude":-2.959167,"State":"MERSEYSIDE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":95637,"ClientName":"Morgan Sindall Construction & Infrastructure Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25708600","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25708601,"JobNameLong":"RCP SMEP WS3","StartDate":"23/11/2017","EndDate":"31/07/2020","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC17","BusinessName":"Science, Industry & Technology","ProjectDirectorID":62941,"ProjectDirectorName":"Andy Pennington","ProjectManagerID":31296,"ProjectManagerName":"Pete Thompson","CountryName":"England","Town":"Liverpool","ScopeOfService":"Civil, structural, mechanical, electrical and public health engineering, acoustics, fire, thermal modelling and sprinkler design.","ScopeOfWorks":"WS3 for a new commercial office development that will be home to the Royal College of Physicians in the North.

Situated on the University’s All Saints campus, the project is to create a new home for schools within the Faculty of Arts and Humanities namely Theatre, and Humanities, Languages and Social Sciences (HLSS) including creative writing and journalism. In doing so, the project seeks to redevelop a prominent site on the City’s Oxford Road corridor which was occupied by the Mabel Tylecote Building. The proposals provide for 12,000m² of new educational, cultural and public spaces, dovetailing with the adjacent Grade II listed Grosvenor Building, the original Manchester School of Art, to create a unified university arts centre. As well as new areas for teaching, the building is being designed to encourage strong public engagement through a porous and active ground floor with many uses. These include the newly established Manchester Poetry Library, a cafe/restaurant, public foyers/exhibition space and a 180-seat studio theatre. In addition, the building houses TV and radio studios, acting and voice studios all constructed as box-in-box to meet low background noise levels. The building is scheduled to be complete in April 2020. For further images see 245271 (pre-novation services. \n\nThe new building is constrained on all 4 sides. The new building abuts the existing Grade II listed Grosvenor building along the West elevation, while a Grade II listed retained façade sits within the footprint of the new building along the North elevation. The new building abuts the Oxford road pavement along the East elevation and Boundary St West along the South elevation. The primary superstructure frame to the new Arts & Humanities building is a hybrid multi-storey frame, comprising aspects of reinforced concrete and steel frame construction. The west half is primarily steel frame and the east half is primarily in situ reinforced concrete frame. A partial movement joint along the interface between the steel and concrete frames prevents lateral load transfer between the two. Cast-in connections are used at the interfaces between steel and concrete frame construction. The areas of steel frame construction and the interface locations are identified on the structural drawings. The steel frame structure is typically of braced frame construction. Long-span, storey-height trusses are required to achieve the long span and stiffness requirements of the floor over the theatre. Floor beams are required to act compositely with the floor slab and therefore require shear studs. The floor slab is typically reinforced concrete on composite metal deck. The reinforced concrete primary superstructure frame is typically in situ flat slab construction, with downstand band beams in long span areas. Transfer beams are provided in locations to achieve adjustments in the structural column grid to suit the architectural layouts.","Latitude":53.469722,"Longitude":-2.237222,"State":"GREATER MANCHESTER","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":95637,"ClientName":"Morgan Sindall Construction & Infrastructure Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25791800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25795000,"JobNameLong":"PRINCES FOODS BRADFORD","StartDate":"25/09/2017","EndDate":"30/06/2018","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":34546,"ProjectDirectorName":"Jim Bell","ProjectManagerID":31234,"ProjectManagerName":"Susie Gregory","CountryName":"England","Town":"Bradford","ScopeOfService":"Structural review of existing floor slabs.","ScopeOfWorks":"Inspection of slabs at Princes Foods warehouse in Bradford.

These proposals have been developed following a significant stakeholder consultation process to ensure the space meets the needs of the end users.","Latitude":53.550278,"Longitude":-1.090278,"State":"SOUTH YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":41917,"ClientName":"Yorkshire Ambulance Service NHS Trust","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25823500","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25828300,"JobNameLong":"CONTACT THEATRE STAGE 5","StartDate":"11/09/2017","EndDate":"26/05/2019","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC01","BusinessName":"Arts & Culture","ProjectDirectorID":48666,"ProjectDirectorName":"Alistair Murray","ProjectManagerID":25542,"ProjectManagerName":"Gareth Ainley","CountryName":"England","Town":"Manchester","ScopeOfService":"Review of design changes, writing a fire strategy","ScopeOfWorks":"Review of design changes on the existing Stage 4 fire strategy","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","State":"GREATER MANCHESTER","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":63141,"ClientName":"Mace Limited","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25828300","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25838300,"JobNameLong":"IP EM KETTERING ELECTRIC STABLING GRIP 5-8 (CAR)","StartDate":"19/10/2017","EndDate":"28/02/2019","CentreName":"Rail NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01212","PracticeName":"Rail Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC14","BusinessName":"Rail","ProjectDirectorID":56600,"ProjectDirectorName":"Tim Clark","ProjectManagerID":48384,"ProjectManagerName":"Bob Gillespie","CountryName":"England","Town":"Kettering","ScopeOfService":"Multi disciplinary detailed design","ScopeOfWorks":"Detailed design of sidings.","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","State":"NORTHAMPTONSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":56028,"ClientName":"Carillion Construction Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25838300","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25843800,"JobNameLong":"BYROM STREET AND BROUGHAM HAYES FIRE REVIEW","StartDate":"16/10/2017","EndDate":"31/07/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":18095,"ProjectDirectorName":"Rav Dhanjal","ProjectManagerID":31236,"ProjectManagerName":"Paul Williams","CountryName":"England","Town":"Liverpool, Bath","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering review of documentation, site inspection and report on fire performance of the building.","ScopeOfWorks":"Fire safety review of two student residential buildings; Byrom Street in Liverpool and Brougham Hayes in Bath.","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","State":"","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":125671,"ClientName":"Curlew Capital","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25843800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25843900,"JobNameLong":"30 NORTH COLONNADE SUMMARY FIRE STRATEGY","StartDate":"10/10/2017","EndDate":"31/05/2018","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":21643,"ProjectDirectorName":"David Stow","ProjectManagerID":21643,"ProjectManagerName":"David Stow","CountryName":"England","Town":"London","ScopeOfService":"Fire strategy document.","ScopeOfWorks":"Compile an updated fire strategy for an office building in Canary Wharf, by referencing previous base build as amended by fit out fire strategies.","Latitude":51.504722,"Longitude":-0.016389,"State":"GREATER LONDON","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":21405,"ClientName":"North Colonnade Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25843900","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25844000,"JobNameLong":"ACM PLOT E2","StartDate":"23/10/2017","EndDate":"30/06/2021","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":23264,"ProjectDirectorName":"David Clixby","ProjectManagerID":31296,"ProjectManagerName":"Pete Thompson","CountryName":"England","Town":"Manchester","ScopeOfService":"Mechanical, electrical and public health, fire and acoustics consultancy.

building at Leeds Beckett University (LBU). Arup acted as Lead Consultant for the refurbishment and replacement of the city campus district heating and hot water generation plant. Arup were also responsible for the Mechanical and Electrical design from concept through to completion including technical adviser role during site phase. The new project replaced an end of life inefficient steam plant, ancillaries, controls and district heating mains, providing a low carbon and reduced energy solution to the campus with a projected financial payback of under five years. The plant includes a Combined Heat and Power installation which increased financial savings through electrical generation, part funded by the University revolving green fund and Salix. Arup worked collaboratively with the University Estates team to ensure a full understanding was gained of the existing system, and the implications of decommissioning the existing heating plant. The existing boiler house was situated within the basement of Portland Building. It supplied heating and domestic hot water services to all four buildings, which make up the City Campus. One of the main issues with the replacement was ensuring that the energy demands of the buildings could be maintained. Arup analysed a variety of options and advised that a temporary oil fired boiler be hired to provide heating for hot water purpose only, whilst installation works are completed. This was to ensure that the campus maintains its hot water provisions.","Latitude":"","Longitude":"","State":"WEST YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":58660,"ClientName":"Leeds Beckett University","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25946700","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25950700,"JobNameLong":"BBC REGIONAL HUBS FIRE REVIEW","StartDate":"03/01/2018","EndDate":"31/05/2020","CentreName":"Fire UK","AccountingCentreCode":"01102","PracticeName":"Fire Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":48666,"ProjectDirectorName":"Alistair Murray","ProjectManagerID":48666,"ProjectManagerName":"Alistair Murray","CountryName":"England","Town":"Birmingham","ScopeOfService":"Fire engineering review of existing BBC estate buildings and provisions of report highlighting differences between fire strategy documents and the current layout and fire safety management provisions.","ScopeOfWorks":"BBC Workplace is the BBC’s department tasked with managing the BBC estate.

The outcome of this exercise enabled the client team to develop a business case for their preferred option and secure the associated funding. Arup was instrumental in the negotiation with the insurer following the fire, ensuring that the technical all queries were rapidly addressed and helping to secure the best financial outcome from the claim. Furthermore, to assist the client team to understand the complex range of redevelopment options, we developed an interactive 3D which enabled them to readily understand the scale of the proposed interventions, but also the associated area and financial figures. Support to Medical Architecture in a 12-week study to review the options to retain, extend or redevelop the fire damaged Building. The building contained millions of pounds of life-saving equipment, including a DNA super-computer, two DNA sequencing machines, two imaging machines and over 25 years of research samples. Arup also developed an iPad app to allow the client to explore building massing options in real-time. The app, a collaboration between the Manchester Structures and Digital teams, was developed using Rhino, Grasshopper and Unity. The client was able to explore a multitude of massing options and visualise what a building of a certain size and height would look like on the site.

To assist the programme Arup recommended a package of enabling works be completed by specialist contractors prior to the start of the extension work, to provide a clear site for the main contractor to take possession of. The brief from the Business School was complex and contained a variety of spaces including lecture theatres, seminar spaces and academic offices, as well as a requirement for the project to be built in phases to suit the funding strategy. Working with the architect Arup developed a scheme which split the project into three distinct extensions, rather than a single extension built in phases, with each extension located in the ideal location for the activities contained within.
