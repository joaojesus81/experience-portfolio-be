Situated on the University’s All Saints campus, the project is to create a new home for schools within the Faculty of Arts and Humanities namely Theatre, and Humanities, Languages and Social Sciences (HLSS) including creative writing and journalism. In doing so, the project seeks to redevelop a prominent site on the City’s Oxford Road corridor which was occupied by the Mabel Tylecote Building. The proposals provide for 12,000m² of new educational, cultural and public spaces, dovetailing with the adjacent Grade II listed Grosvenor Building, the original Manchester School of Art, to create a unified university arts centre. As well as new areas for teaching, the building is being designed to encourage strong public engagement through a porous and active ground floor with many uses. These include the newly established Manchester Poetry Library, a cafe/restaurant, public foyers/exhibition space and a 180-seat studio theatre. In addition, the building houses TV and radio studios, acting and voice studios all constructed as box-in-box to meet low background noise levels. The building is scheduled to be complete in April 2020. For further images see 245271 (pre-novation services. \n\nThe new building is constrained on all 4 sides. The new building abuts the existing Grade II listed Grosvenor building along the West elevation, while a Grade II listed retained façade sits within the footprint of the new building along the North elevation. The new building abuts the Oxford road pavement along the East elevation and Boundary St West along the South elevation. The primary superstructure frame to the new Arts & Humanities building is a hybrid multi-storey frame, comprising aspects of reinforced concrete and steel frame construction. The west half is primarily steel frame and the east half is primarily in situ reinforced concrete frame. A partial movement joint along the interface between the steel and concrete frames prevents lateral load transfer between the two. Cast-in connections are used at the interfaces between steel and concrete frame construction. The areas of steel frame construction and the interface locations are identified on the structural drawings. The steel frame structure is typically of braced frame construction. Long-span, storey-height trusses are required to achieve the long span and stiffness requirements of the floor over the theatre. Floor beams are required to act compositely with the floor slab and therefore require shear studs. The floor slab is typically reinforced concrete on composite metal deck. The reinforced concrete primary superstructure frame is typically in situ flat slab construction, with downstand band beams in long span areas. Transfer beams are provided in locations to achieve adjustments in the structural column grid to suit the architectural layouts.","Latitude":53.469722,"Longitude":-2.237222,"State":"GREATER MANCHESTER","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":95637,"ClientName":"Morgan Sindall Construction & Infrastructure Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25791800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25845800,"JobNameLong":"BUILDING THE LEEDS WAY (C&S) OBC STAGE","StartDate":"23/10/2017","EndDate":"31/08/2020","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC08","BusinessName":"Healthcare","ProjectDirectorID":34546,"ProjectDirectorName":"Jim Bell","ProjectManagerID":17049,"ProjectManagerName":"Derek Roberts","CountryName":"England","Town":"Leeds","ScopeOfService":"Civil and structural engineering design.","ScopeOfWorks":"c.£300million scheme for consolidation of Leeds Teaching Hospitals and expansion into research.","Latitude":53.806944,"Longitude":-1.519167,"State":"WEST YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":99.67,"ClientID":58686,"ClientName":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25845800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25856300,"JobNameLong":"DATA CENTRE HULL UNI","StartDate":"30/10/2017","EndDate":"31/07/2020","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC17","BusinessName":"Science, Industry & Technology","ProjectDirectorID":24217,"ProjectDirectorName":"Craig Havenhand","ProjectManagerID":24217,"ProjectManagerName":"Craig Havenhand","CountryName":"England","Town":"Hull","ScopeOfService":"Mechanical, electrical, and public health engineering, and acoustics.
