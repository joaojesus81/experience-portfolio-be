This identified problem areas that were not accounted for in the spine system. Arup highlighted potential risk areas to the client and possible solutions. Part of this holistic assessment also saved the need for surface water pumping in one location—reducing cost and long term maintenance requirements. Arup adopted an approach to designing building drainage systems that minimised deep chambers, reducing the need for risky confined space access during maintenance. A number of value engineering opportunities were identified by Arup by challenging the tender design, including materials selection, and allowing certain areas to flood for extreme storms where there would be little or no consequences. A range of sustainable initiatives have been incorporated, which include the reuse of clean site arising for bund features and the use of swales and other SUDS elements.

The site was formerly the home of a large coal fired power station and the works included its demolition, moving high voltage infrastructure, two new bridges over the river, providing five new academic buildings, restoring a listed building, building a student village, a hotel and an energy centre complete with mechanical and electrical infrastructure to serve the campus. \n\nThis new campus comprises 40,000m² of teaching space across five new academic buildings Learning Hub, Creative Hub, Senate Building, Sports Hub and Logistics Hub), including the refurbishment of a listed building and all the public realm works to redevelop the entire site around the academic, residential and utility buildings. The buildings have been designed to accommodate all the teaching, learning, admin, commercial and leisure activities as well as providing exemplary learning and working environments for the occupants, with high energy performance. \n\nThe Learning Hub is the largest building of 21,000m² at the heart of the new campus. This five-storey building houses a library, shared general teaching areas, specialists’ skills spaces, student administration, academic workspaces and catering. It will be open 24 hours a day and will create a vibrant, dynamic and flexible environment. The Creative Hub is a 10,000m² building over five storeys and brings together all the creative art, design and performing art disciplines and science teaching into one building. The Senate Building is a 5,600m² building and is the main reception building for the University and accommodates the senior management team and outward facing research space. This four-storey building houses the campus reception, general teaching, lecture theatre, seminar rooms and conference facilities. The Sports Hub provides sports and changing facilities and laboratories and the Logistics Hub is an industrial unit to provide open plan for storage of waste and maintenance equipment and an office area. The Engine Shed is an existing grade II listed locomotive building which has been restored and converted into a student union building and offices.

MB enables ease of construction and allows distributed fabrication, so those with limited experience can build to a high quality, meeting Passivhaus standards where desired, at a lower cost than traditional building methods. Whilst discussing prefabricated houses to meet the housing crisis, Design for Homes’ David Birkbeck said: ‘Prefab works well if you have extensive repetition. But we don’t do repetition in the UK because… of oddly shaped pieces of land requiring sensitive responses… we have yet to see a successful example that has broken out from the niche.’ MB Bespoke addresses this issue by incorporating parametrics into a system that can output bespoke, modular, prefabricated houses, the issue of varying land shape & form is ameliorated by overcoming the previous constraints of repetition. MB brings increased level of cost/build certainty to early design stages, making building easier to engage with.","Latitude":53.82,"Longitude":-1.5125,"State":"","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":46575,"ClientName":"Bauman Lyons Architects Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=24582200","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":24598900,"JobNameLong":"250 CITY ROAD - DUE DILLIGENCE SUPPORT","StartDate":"30/08/2015","EndDate":"31/01/2019","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC10","BusinessName":"Hotels & Leisure","ProjectDirectorID":20126,"ProjectDirectorName":"Neil Hooton","ProjectManagerID":20126,"ProjectManagerName":"Neil Hooton","CountryName":"England","Town":"London","ScopeOfService":"Ad hoc civil and structural engineering advice and due diligence to AXA through JLL.

The retail space totals 100,000 sq ft over two floors, while the office space totals 155,000ft² of net lettable space arranged over four floors around a central atrium. The majority of the office has been designed for a financial institution, with an exclusive entrance from the north east corner of the building. The balance of the office space is being built on speculative basis and is accessed from a separate entrance on the opposite end of the building. There is a set back at the uppermost level to create a south-facing roof terrace. The main roof has a plant screen set back from the facades and provides the location for the MEP equipment.\n\nIn addition to the office and retail space there is circa 25,000ft² of ancillary space associated with the main office tenant including 19 car spaces, cycle facilities and a back of house function along with a service yard. The majority of this is within a basement area that partially sits outside the building footprint.\n\nThe overarching energy strategy for the project is built around demand minimisation supported by robust engineering systems that utilise energy efficiency over the full range of annual operating conditions. Where technology is adopted to enhance the energy performance it will be proven and integrated in to the total building solution to provide reliable performance without compromising the building operational needs. In response to the City Council planning policy, the building takes benefit from the city wide district heating, providing a source of low carbon energy, and limiting the need for boiler flues exhausts within the building.\n\nThe services strategy has been developed to maintain clear segregation between the Financial Institution and retail MEP services installation, and associated access and maintenance.\nThe Sub-Tenant areas within the Financial Institution floorplate/s will be fed from the Financial Institution infrastructure with metering as required to apportion energy usage. Retail will be serviced from centralised ventilation, heating and cooling plant:\n\n• Heating and water plant rooms are to be located within the basement within retail plant room having a dedicated district heating connection, the retail will have no boiler flues.\n• Ventilation plant is intended to be installed within the plant room on mezzanine Level 20. Supply and extract louvres from the retail plant room will discharge towards Galleria/Pinstone Street.\n• Centralised cooling plant will be located on the roof of the nearest Food and Beverage Units accessed from Charter Row.\n• Food and beverage (F&B) kitchen extract fans will be located on the F&B roof plant area.\n\nThe office includes for all ventilation plant at roof level with space for dedicated plant to the restaurant and gym. The office landlords life safety generator will be located at roof level being coordinated to ensure exhaust maintain separation from fresh air intakes. As the site falls away from front to back by approximately one clear storey, opportunity has been taken to create a large basement/at grade plant room zone for Financial Institution MEP services. These prime plant rooms will accommodate many all of the heavy bulk water (potable and sprinkler) and standby generator fuel storage tanks, substations, and main incoming services with defined routes to the foot of each core riser. Access to the basement plant areas will be through the dedicated secure basement car park.","Latitude":53.378333,"Longitude":-1.472222,"State":"SOUTH YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":87659,"ClientName":"Bam Construction Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=24907400","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":24955000,"JobNameLong":"TEMPLE QUARTER DEVELOPMENT","StartDate":"27/03/2016","EndDate":"31/03/2022","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC03","BusinessName":"Property","ProjectDirectorID":30039,"ProjectDirectorName":"Jaff Versi","ProjectManagerID":30039,"ProjectManagerName":"Jaff Versi","CountryName":"England","Town":"Leeds","ScopeOfService":"Multidiscipline support to masterplan outline planning application.","ScopeOfWorks":"New build mixed commercial and residential development in Holbeck Leeds - Temple Quarter Development (also known as Leeds' South Bank).

Situated on the University’s All Saints campus, the project is to create a new home for schools within the Faculty of Arts and Humanities namely Theatre, and Humanities, Languages and Social Sciences (HLSS) including creative writing and journalism. In doing so, the project seeks to redevelop a prominent site on the City’s Oxford Road corridor which was occupied by the Mabel Tylecote Building. The proposals provide for 12,000m² of new educational, cultural and public spaces, dovetailing with the adjacent Grade II listed Grosvenor Building, the original Manchester School of Art, to create a unified university arts centre. As well as new areas for teaching, the building is being designed to encourage strong public engagement through a porous and active ground floor with many uses. These include the newly established Manchester Poetry Library, a cafe/restaurant, public foyers/exhibition space and a 180-seat studio theatre. In addition, the building houses TV and radio studios, acting and voice studios all constructed as box-in-box to meet low background noise levels. The building is scheduled to be complete in April 2020. For further images see 245271 (pre-novation services. \n\nThe new building is constrained on all 4 sides. The new building abuts the existing Grade II listed Grosvenor building along the West elevation, while a Grade II listed retained façade sits within the footprint of the new building along the North elevation. The new building abuts the Oxford road pavement along the East elevation and Boundary St West along the South elevation. The primary superstructure frame to the new Arts & Humanities building is a hybrid multi-storey frame, comprising aspects of reinforced concrete and steel frame construction. The west half is primarily steel frame and the east half is primarily in situ reinforced concrete frame. A partial movement joint along the interface between the steel and concrete frames prevents lateral load transfer between the two. Cast-in connections are used at the interfaces between steel and concrete frame construction. The areas of steel frame construction and the interface locations are identified on the structural drawings. The steel frame structure is typically of braced frame construction. Long-span, storey-height trusses are required to achieve the long span and stiffness requirements of the floor over the theatre. Floor beams are required to act compositely with the floor slab and therefore require shear studs. The floor slab is typically reinforced concrete on composite metal deck. The reinforced concrete primary superstructure frame is typically in situ flat slab construction, with downstand band beams in long span areas. Transfer beams are provided in locations to achieve adjustments in the structural column grid to suit the architectural layouts.","Latitude":53.469722,"Longitude":-2.237222,"State":"GREATER MANCHESTER","PercentComplete":100,"ClientID":95637,"ClientName":"Morgan Sindall Construction & Infrastructure Ltd","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25791800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25845800,"JobNameLong":"BUILDING THE LEEDS WAY (C&S) OBC STAGE","StartDate":"23/10/2017","EndDate":"31/08/2020","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC08","BusinessName":"Healthcare","ProjectDirectorID":34546,"ProjectDirectorName":"Jim Bell","ProjectManagerID":17049,"ProjectManagerName":"Derek Roberts","CountryName":"England","Town":"Leeds","ScopeOfService":"Civil and structural engineering design.","ScopeOfWorks":"c.£300million scheme for consolidation of Leeds Teaching Hospitals and expansion into research.","Latitude":53.806944,"Longitude":-1.519167,"State":"WEST YORKSHIRE","PercentComplete":99.67,"ClientID":58686,"ClientName":"Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust","ProjectURL":"http://projects.intranet.arup.com/?layout=projects.proj.view&jp=OA&jn=25845800","Confidential":0},{"ProjectCode":25856300,"JobNameLong":"DATA CENTRE HULL UNI","StartDate":"30/10/2017","EndDate":"31/07/2020","CentreName":"Buildings NW & Yorkshire","AccountingCentreCode":"01419","PracticeName":"Building Engineering","BusinessCode":"BC17","BusinessName":"Science, Industry & Technology","ProjectDirectorID":24217,"ProjectDirectorName":"Craig Havenhand","ProjectManagerID":24217,"ProjectManagerName":"Craig Havenhand","CountryName":"England","Town":"Hull","ScopeOfService":"Mechanical, electrical, and public health engineering, and acoustics.
